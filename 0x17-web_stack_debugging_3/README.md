Project: 0x17. Web stack debugging #3
Description
This project focuses on debugging a Wordpress website running on a LAMP stack. The goal is to identify and fix issues that are not easily traceable through logs alone. By delving into the stack, we aim to resolve unexpected errors and improve the overall functionality of the website.

Requirements
Ensure that Puppet manifests pass puppet-lint version 2.1.1 without any errors.
Puppet manifests must run without any errors.
The first line of each Puppet manifest should be a comment explaining its purpose.
Steps to Debug
Identify the specific issue or error affecting the Wordpress website.
Review the Puppet manifests for any potential misconfigurations or errors.
Debug the LAMP stack components (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) to pinpoint the root cause.
Implement necessary fixes in the Puppet manifests to resolve the issues.
Testing
After making changes to the Puppet manifests, ensure to test the website thoroughly to confirm that the issues have been successfully resolved.

Additional Notes
Wordpress is a widely used platform, and understanding how to debug issues within a LAMP stack environment is a valuable skill for any developer working with web technologies.

Feel free to enhance this README file with more detailed information or specific instructions based on your debugging process and findings during the project. Happy debugging!
